# Overview

The Cloudron provides a RESTful API to manage all aspects of the Cloudron like
adding users, configuring groups and installing apps.

If you are an app developer, the [Cloudron CLI tool](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudron) implements a workflow that allows
you to develop apps on your Cloudron. The CLI tool uses the REST API documented here.

## API Origin

The Cloudron API is available at the `my` subdomain of your Cloudron.

For example, if the Cloudron is on a custom domain, then this would be `https://my.customdomain.com`. If the
Cloudron is on a `cloudron.me` subdomain, then this would be `https://my-demo.cloudron.me`.

# Authentication

## Getting API Tokens

POST `/api/v1/developer/login` <scope>admin</scope>

Creates a token given user credentials.

Request:
```
{
    username: <string>,
    password: <string>
}
```

Set `username` to your username and `password` to your password. Currently, only Cloudron administrators can
create API tokens.

Response (200):
```
{
    token: <string>,        // Token used for accessing the API
    expiresAt: <date>       // ISO-8601 UTC date the token expires
}
```

Curl example:
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "cloudron", "password":"cloudron"}' https://my-demo.cloudron.me/api/v1/developer/login
```

## Using API tokens

The access token can either be provided via the request query `?access_token=<token>`.

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" https://$CLOUDRON_ORIGIN/api/v1/users?access_token=$TOKEN
```

Alternately, the token can be provided via the `Authorization` header using `Bearer <token>`.

```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" https://$CLOUDRON_ORIGIN/api/v1/users
```

## OAuth

OAuth authentication is meant to be used by apps. An app can get an OAuth token using the
[oauth](addons.html#oauth) or [simpleauth](addons.html#simpleauth) addon.

Tokens obtained via OAuth have a restricted scope wherein they can only access the user's profile.
This restriction is so that apps cannot make undesired changes to the user's Cloudron.

The access token can be provided either via the request query `?access_token=<token>` or in the
`Authorization` header using `Bearer <token>`.

# REST

## Requests

All requests must be made via `https` protocol to ensure that the connection is encrypted.

The general idea behind HTTP methods is:
* Use `GET` to retrieve resource information
* Use `DELETE` to destroy a resource
* Use `PUT` to update an existing resource
* Use `POST` to create a new resource

## Error

Error response objects have a `status` field indicating the HTTP error and a `message` field containing
a detailed description of the error.

## Pagination

APIs that list objects take a `page` query parameters to indicate the page number starting from index 1.
The `per_page` query parameter can be used to specify the number of items to be returned.

# Endpoints

## Apps

### Install app

POST `/api/v1/apps/install`  <scope>admin</scope>

Request:

```
{
    location: <string>,              // required: the subdomain on which to install the app
    appStoreId: <string>[@<semver>], // required: Cloudron Store Id of the app. Alternately, provide a manifest
    manifest: <manifest>,            // manifest of the app to install. required if appStoreId is unset.
    portBindings: null || {          // mapping from application ports to public ports
    },
    accessRestriction: null || {     // required. list of users and groups who can access this application
        users: [ ],
        groups: [ ]
    },
    icon: <string>,                  // icon as base64 encoded string
    cert: <string>,                  // pem encoded TLS cert
    key: <string>,                   // pem encoded TLS key
    memoryLimit: <number>,           // memory constraint in bytes
    altDomain: <string>,             // alternate domain from which this app can be reached
    xFrameOptions: <string>          // set X-Frame-Options header, to control which websites can embed this app
}
```

`appStoreId` is the [Cloudron Store](https://cloudron.io/appstore.html) Id of this application. For example,
`io.gogs.cloudronapp` is the id of Gogs app. A specific version can be specified using the '@' suffix. For
apps that are not published on the Cloudron Store, skip this field and provide a `manifest` instead. Apps
with an `appStoreId` will automatically be kept up-to-date as newer version of the app are published on the
store.

`manifest` is the [manifest](https://cloudron.io/references/manifest.html) of the app to be installed. This
is only required if `appStoreId` is not provided. Apps with a manifest won't receive automatic updates.

`location` is the subdomain on which the app is installed. This can be empty if the app was installed on the naked domain.
If another app already exists in the same location, 409 is returned.

For apps that require login, `accessRestriction` is the *restricted* list of users and groups that can access this app.
If null, any user of this Cloudron can access this app. Note that the `accessRestriction` field only works if the app
is integrated with Cloudron Authentication.

`icon` is an application icon that is displayed in the web ui. If not provided, this is automatically downloaded
from the Cloudron Store (or uses a fallback icon).

`cert` and `key` provide the TLS certificates. If the domain name of the app does not must match with the certificate
provided, a 400 will be returned.

If `altDomain` is set, the app can be accessed from `https://<altDomain>`.

`xFrameOptions` can hold one of the following values:
* `DENY` - to prevent embedding from any website
* `SAMEORIGIN` - allows embedding from the same domain as the app. This is the default.
* `ALLOW-FROM https://example.com/` - allows this app to be embedded from example.com

Read more about the options at [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Frame-Options).

Response (200):

```
{
    id: <string>,                    // a unique id for the app
}
```

On success, the installation progress can be tracked by polling [installationProgress](/references/api.html#get-app).

Curl example to install Gogs app at subdomain git-demo.cloudron.me:
```
curl -X POST -d '{ "appStoreId": "io.gogs.cloudronapp", "location": "git", "accessRestriction": null }' -H 'Authorization: Bearer f34eb4d0d942c8f8b3c060f356f1bb6961bc07bfb3fa2b24188a240f3de975f5' https://my-demo.cloudron.me/api/v1/apps/install
```

Curl example to install specific version of Gogs app with SSH Port exposed at 6000:
```
curl -X  POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer 27ab70cfd10e615ec29f6d890947e2b72db47522754bfafcad6f9c0e6c9e84e9" -d '{ "appStoreId": "io.gogs.cloudronapp@0.12.6", "portBindings": { "SSH_PORT": 6000 }, "location": "git2", "accessRestriction": null }' https://my-donut.cloudron.eu/api/v1/apps/install
```

To restrict access to Gogs app to the *developers* group:
```
curl -X  POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer 27ab70cfd10e615ec29f6d890947e2b72db47522754bfafcad6f9c0e6c9e84e9" -d '{ "appStoreId": "io.gogs.cloudronapp@0.12.6", "location": "git3", "accessRestriction": { "groups": [ "developers" ] } }' https://my-demo.cloudron.me/api/v1/apps/install
```

### Get app

GET `/api/v1/apps/:appId` <scope>admin</scope>

Gets information about the app with id `appId`.

Response (200):

```
{
    id: <string>,                    // a unique id for the app
    appStoreId: <string>,            // Cloudron Store Id for updates
    manifest: <manifest>,            // current manifest of the app

    accessRestriction: null || {     // list of users and groups who can access this application
        users: [ ],
        groups: [ ]
    },
    lastBackupId: <string>,          // last known backup of this app
    manifest: <manifest>,            // the application manifest
    portBindings: {                  // mapping from application ports to public ports
    },
    iconUrl: <url>,                  // a relative url providing the icon
    memoryLimit: <number>            // memory constraint in bytes
}
```

`id` is an unique id for this application.

`appStoreId` is the Cloudron Store id of this application. Cloudron will use this id to look for updates to this application. This can be null if none was provided at installation time.

`manifest` is the [Cloudron Manifest](/references/manifest.html) of the app.

`installationState` is one of the values below:
* `pending_install` - The app is being installed. Use the `installationProgress` field to track the progress.
* `pending_configure` - The app is being re-configured. For example, if the app was moved to a new location or the port bindings was changed.
* `pending_uinstall` - The app is being uninstalled.
* `pending_restore` - The app is being restored from a previous backup.
* `pending_update` - The app is being updated.
* `pending_force_update` - The app is being force-updated.
* `pending_backup` - The app is being backed up.
* `error` - There was an error executing one of the above pending commands.
* `installed` - The app is installed. Use the `runState` and `health` to determine if the app is running and healthy.

`installationProgress` is a string indicating the progress when the app's `installationState` is one of the `pending_*` states. It is
of the format `<percent>, <message>`.

`runState` is one of the values below:
* `pending_start` - The app is being started.
* `pending_stop` - The app is being stopped.
* `stopped` - The app was stopped.
* `running` - The app is running.

`health` is one of the values below:
* `healthy` - The app is responding to health checks and is healthy.
* `unhealthy` - The app is not responding to health checks.
* `error` - There was an error checking the health of the app.
* `dead` - The app is dead. Most likely it was stopped or being uninstalled.

`location` is the subdomain on which the app is installed. This can be empty if the app was installed on the naked domain. The app can be
accessed from `fqdn` i.e `https//<fqdn>`. If `altDomain` is set, the app should be accessed from `https://<altDomain>`.

For apps that require login, `accessRestriction` is the *restricted* list of users and groups that can access this app.
If null, any user of this Cloudron can access this app. Note that the `accessRestriction` field only works if the app
is integrated with Cloudron Authentication.


`lastBackupId` is the last valid backup id. The [restore API](/references/api.html#restore-app) can be used to restore the app to this backup.

`manifest` is the [application manifest](/references/manifest.html).

### List apps

GET `/api/v1/apps/:appId` <scope>admin</scope>

Gets the list of installed apps.

Response (200):

```
{
    apps: [
        {
            id: <string>,                    // a unique id for the app
            appStoreId: <string>,            // Cloudron Store Id for updates
            manifest: <manifest>,            // current manifest of the app

            fqdn: <string>,                  // the FQDN of this app
            altDomain: <string>              // alternate domain from which this app can be reached
            accessRestriction: null || {     // list of users and groups who can access this application
                users: [ ],
                groups: [ ]
            },
            lastBackupId: <string>,          // last known backup of this app

            portBindings: {                  // mapping for application ports to public ports
            },
            iconUrl: <url>,                  // a relative url providing the icon
            memoryLimit: <number>            // memory constraint in bytes
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

### Get icon

GET `/api/v1/apps/:appId/icon` <scope>admin</scope>

Gets the icon of the application with id `appId` as `image/png`.

The icon is used in the display at Cloudron admin UI.

### Backup app

POST `/api/v1/apps/:appId/backup` <scope>admin</scope>

Starts a backup of the application with id `appId`.

The backup progress can be tracked by polling the value of [installationProgress](/references/api.html#get-app).

### List app backups

GET `/api/v1/apps/:appId/backups` <scope>admin</scope>

Gets the backups of the application with id `appId`.

Use the [Backup](/references/api.html#download-backup) API to download the backup.

Response (200):

```
{
    backups: [
        {
            id: <string>,                   // a unique id for this backup
            creationTime: <date>,           // ISO-8601 date in UTC
            version: <semver>,              // the app version
            type: <string>,                 // 'app'
            dependsOn: [ <string>, ... ],   // always an empty array for app backups
            state: <string>                 // 'normal'
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

### Restore app

POST `/api/v1/apps/:appId/restore` <scope>admin</scope>

Restores the app from a backup.

Request:

```
{
    backupId: null || <string>
}
```

`backupId` is an id from the [list app backups](/references/api.html#list-app-backups) API.

Note that app backups are tied to the app's version (see the `version` field of the backup). So, restoring
an app may result in reverting the app to a previous version.

Setting backupId to `null` has the same effect as reinstalling the application.

### Clone app

POST `/api/v1/apps/:appId/clone` <scope>admin</scope>

Clones the app from a backup.

Request:

```
{
    backupId: <string>,            // required. the cloned app will start with this data.
    location: <string>,            // required. the subdomain for the cloned app
    portBindings: null || {        // required. mapping from application ports to public ports
    }
}
```

`backupId` is an id from the [list app backups](/references/api.html#list-app-backups) API.

`location` is a subdomain for the cloned app and will result in a 409 in case of a conflict.

`portBindings` is a list of new tcp port mappings for the cloned app.

Response(201):

```
    {
        id: <string>                // app id of the new app
    }
```

The clone progress can be tracked by polling the value of [installationProgress](/references/api.html#get-app).
Be sure to use the `id` of the new app returned above and not the original app's id.

### Get logs

GET `/api/v1/apps/:appId/logs` <scope>admin</scope>

Get the logs of an application with id `appId`.

The `lines` query parameter can be used to specify the number of log lines to download.

The response has `Content-Type` set to 'application/x-logs' and `Content-Disposition` set to
`attachment; filename="log.txt`.

Response(200):

```
Line delimited JSON.

    {
        realtimeTimestamp: <number>,          // wallclock timestamp
        monotonicTimestamp: <number>,         // time passed since boot
        message: [ <byte>,... ],              // utf8 buffer
        source: <process name>                // source of this message
    }
```

Logs are aggregated from one or more `source`s. The application logs have the `source` set to `main`.
Other sources include `scheduler`.

### Get log stream

GET `/api/v1/apps/:appId/logstream` <scope>admin</scope>

Stream the logs of an application with id `appId` as a `text/event-stream`. See the [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource)
interface documentation for details.

The `lines` query parameter can be used to specify the number of log lines to prefetch.

Response(200):

```
Line delimited JSON

    {
        realtimeTimestamp: <number>,          // wallclock timestamp
        monotonicTimestamp: <number>,         // time passed since boot
        message: [ <byte>,... ],              // utf8 buffer
        source: <process name>                // source of this message
    }
```
Logs are aggregated from one or more `source`s. The application logs have the `source` set to `main`.
Other sources include `scheduler`.

### Configure app

POST `/api/v1/apps/:appId/configure` <scope>admin</scope>

Re-configures an existing app with id `appId`.

Configuring an app won't preserve existing data. Cloudron apps are written in a way to support reconfiguring
any of the parameters listed below without loss of data.

Request:
```
    location: <string>,            // the subdomain on which to install the app
    portBindings: null || {        // mapping from application ports to public ports
    },
    accessRestriction: null || {   // required. list of users and groups who can access this application
        users: [ ],
        groups: [ ]
    },
    icon: <string>,                 // icon as base64 encoded string
    cert: <string>,                 // pem encoded TLS cert
    key: <string>,                  // pem encoded TLS key
    memoryLimit: <number>,          // memory constraint in bytes
    altDomain: <string>,            // alternate domain from which this app can be reached
    xFrameOptions: <string>         // set X-Frame-Options header, to control which websites can embed this app
```

All values are optional. See [Install app](/references/api.html#install-app) API for field descriptions.

### Get Mailbox

GET `/api/v1/apps/:appId/mailbox` <scope>admin</scope>

Gets the name of the mailbox used to send and receive email.

Only apps that have the capablity of processing mail (via the `sendmail` and `recvmail` addons) have a
mailbox.

Response (200):
```
{
    mailbox: <string>
}
```

### Set Mailbox

POST `/api/v1/apps/:appId/mailbox` <scope>admin</scope>

Sets the name of the mailbox used to send and receive mail.

The name of the mailbox cannot conflict with existing user and group names. In addition, only apps
that have the capablity of processing mail (via the `sendmail` and `recvmail` addons) can have a
mailbox. A 409 is either of these cases.

Request:
```
{
        mailbox: <string>
}
```

### Update app

POST `/api/v1/apps/:appId/update` <scope>admin</scope>

Updates an app with id `appId`.

Updating an app updrades (or downgrades) the app preserving existing data. To be safe, the update process
makes a backup of existing app data first before updating the app. This allow you to
[restore the app](/references/api.html#restore-app) should the upgrade fail.

Only apps that are installed, running and responding to health checks can generate a consistent back up.
For this reason, it is not possible to update apps that are in any other state. To override this, use
the `force` parameter described below.

Request:

```
{
    appStoreId: <string>[@<semver>], // the new version of the app
    manifest: <manifest>,            // the manifest of the app
    portBindings: {                  // optional
    },
    icon: <string>,                  // optional
    force: <boolean>                 // optional. default: false
}
```

`appStoreId` is the id of the app to install from the Cloudron Store. The API does not verify that
the version provided here is greater than the existing app version allowing you to downgrade apps.
Downgrading should be used with extreme care because the older version of the app may not understand
the format of existing data (for example, new db schema may not be understod by the older version).

`manifest` provides information of the new app version that the app needs to be updated to. This is
only required if appStoreId was not provided at installation time.

If the new version of the app requires new ports to be allocated for the app, then mapping for the new ports
can be provided in `portBindings`.

`icon` specifies any new icon as a base64 encoded string for the updated version of the app.

The Cloudron will only update apps that are installed, running and responding to health checks. Before
each update, the app is backed up so that it may be restored easily in case of a bad update.

`force` can be used to force an update even if the app is in a state which prevents an update. This is
useful during app development, where you can force a crashed app to update to the latest code.

The update progress can be tracked by polling the value of [installationProgress](/references/api.html#get-app).

Curl example to update Gogs to a new version 0.13.0:
```
curl -X POST -d '{ "appStoreId": "io.gogs.cloudronapp@0.13.0" }' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer 256e4c6c6f783dbff95ae233c63a36e297ef70a3528171b891a399f895a8e0e0' https://my-demo.cloudron.me/api/v1/apps/aaa8ad53-301b-4a77-9551-5df261686166/update
```

### Exec

GET `/api/v1/apps/:appId/exec` <scope>admin</scope>

Executes an arbitrary command in the context of the app.

Query Parameters:
* `cmd`: JSON encoded string array of the command to execute. default: '/bin/bash'
* `rows`: optional. the tty window row size
* `columns`: optional. the tty window column size
* `tty`: set to true if a tty should be allocated

In order to provide separate streams for **stdout** and **stderr**, the http connection
is upgraded to **tcp** using the following headers:
```
Upgrade: tcp
Connection: Upgrade
```

Once upgraded, the connection provides a full-duplex tcp connection. Clients can write **stdin**
to the connection. If a `tty` was allocated, then the server provides stdout and stderr as a
single stream. If no `tty` was allocated, then the server writes data in the following format:

```
<stream type> <size> <payload>
```

See the [Docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api_v1.19/#attach-to-a-container)
for details.

Curl example to execute 'ls' command:
```
curl -H 'Upgrade: tcp' -H 'Connection: Upgrade' -H 'Authorization: Bearer eba011a45eb056c7497820c408d1170e94ac7ed0fb10cef798fcdaacbcbcd2ee' 'https://my-demo.cloudron.me/api/v1/apps/41dfe1f1-edb3-4011-9ba3-889d0b24a177/exec?cmd=%5B%22ls%22%5D&tty=true'
```

### Start app

POST `/api/v1/apps/:appId/start` <scope>admin</scope>

Starts an app.

If the app cannot be started, the response code is 409. This can happen if the
app is in a state where it cannot started (for example, it is still installing).

### Stop app

POST `/api/v1/apps/:appId/stop` <scope>admin</scope>

Stops an app.

If the app cannot be stopped, the response code is 409. This can happen if the
app is in a state where it cannot stopped (for example, it is installing).

When an app is stopped, the app's location will show an error page indicating
that the app is not running.

### Uninstall app

POST `/api/v1/apps/:appId/uninstall` <scope>admin</scope>

Uninstalls an app.

The existing backups of the app are still preserved (as per the backup configuration) and the
backup can be used to restore the app to the same state later.

## Backups

### Create a backup

POST  `/api/v1/backups` <scope>admin</scope>

Schedules a complete backup of the Cloudron.

Use the [Progress API](/references/api.html#get-progress) to track the progress of the backup.

### List backups

GET `/api/v1/backups` <scope>admin</scope>

Lists the existing `box` backups.

The Cloudron has two types of backups:
* `app` backups - Each app is backed up individually. This approach allows one to restore each app
independently of other apps. Use the [app backup API](/references/api.html#list-app-backups), if
you want to list the backups of a specific app.
* `box` backups - The Cloudron backs up certificates, user information, settings separately. This
backup contains a (virtual) link to all the app backups .

Response (200):
```
{
    backups: [
        {
            id: <string>,                   // a unique id for this backup
            creationTime: <date>,           // ISO-8601 date in UTC
            version: <semver>,              // the Cloudron version when this backup was created
            type: <string>,                 // `box`
            dependsOn: [ <string>, ... ],   // list of app backups that are part of this box backup
            state: <string>                 // 'normal'
        },
        ...
    ]
}
```

### Download backup

POST `/api/v1/backups/:backupId/download_url` <scope>admin</scope>

Generates a temporary URL to download the backup with id `backupId`.

All backups are encrypted and tar zipped. `backupKey` returned in the response can be used to
decrypt the backup.

Response (200):
```
{
    id: <string>,
    url: <url>,                      // download backups from this url
    backupKey: <string>              // key to use to decrypt the backup
}
```

Curl example to download, decrypt and extract backup to current directory:
```
curl -L <url> | openssl aes-256-cbc -d -pass "pass:$<backupKey>" | tar -zxf -
```

## Cloudron

### Update the Cloudron

POST `/api/v1/cloudron/update` <scope>admin</scope>

Updates the Cloudron to the latest version.

If no new version is available, the response code will be 422.

Some actions and events on the Cloudron like backups, app installs may block the Cloudron from updating.
In such a case, the response code will be 409.

If the update request was accepted, the response code will be 202. Use the [Progress API](/references/api.html#get-progress)
to track the progress of the update.

    update: null || { percent: <number>, message: <string> },
    backup: null || { percent: <number>, message: <string> }
}
```

### Get status

GET `/api/v1/cloudron/status` <scope>public</scope>

Gets information about the Cloudron state and how it got provisioned.

```
Response (200):

## Eventlog

### List events

GET `/api/v1/eventlog` <scope>admin</scope>

Lists all the past events.

The `action` query parameter can be used to list events of a specific action.

The `search` query parameter can be used to do a wildcard ('*search*') on the data field.

This API supports [pagination](/references/api.html#pagination) - use the `page` and `per_page` query parameters to get specific pages.

Response (200):

```
{
    eventlogs: [
        {
            id: <string>,            // unique id for the event
            action: <enum>,          // see below
            source: <object>,        // originator of this event
            data: <object>,          // value depends on action. see below
            creationTime: <date>     // ISO-8601 date in UTC
        },
        ....
    ]
}
```

`action` is one of the values below:
* cloudron.activate
* app.configure
* app.install
* app.restore
* app.uninstall
* app.update
* backup.finish
* backup.start
* certificate.renew
* settings.climode
* cloudron.start
* cloudron.update
* user.add
* user.login
* user.remove
* user.update

`source` contains information on the originator of the action. For example, for user.login, this contains the IP address, the appId and the authType (ldap or simpleauth or oauth).

`data` contains information on the event itself. For example, for user.login, this contains the userId that logged in. For app.install, it contains the manifest and location of the app that was installed.

To list all the app installation events:
```
curl -X GET -H 'Authorization: Bearer cb0463455a6606482be7956fc3abd53330ae23244e3492cda3914a2c5154c47e' https://my-demo.cloudron.me/api/v1/eventlog?action=app.install
```

}
```

### Set groups

PUT `/api/v1/users/:userId/groups` <scope>admin</scope>

Sets the groups for the user with id `userId`.

Groups are identified by groupIds which can be retrieved using the
[Groups API](/references/api.html#list-all-groups).

An admin cannot remove himself from the special `admin` group. This will result in a response code of 403.

Note that this call will replace the current groups for this user, it does **not** merge the provided ones with the current groups for that user.

effect of a deletion may not be immediately visible until the user logs out.

Response (204):
```
{}
```
